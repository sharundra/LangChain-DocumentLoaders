In quiet frames where shadows speak,
He taught the world to hear the meek—
A child’s soft gaze, a mother’s sigh,
The rustle of truth passing by.

He showed that stories need no roar,
Just honest hearts and human lore;
From village paths to city scars,
He caught life’s pulse between the stars.

Characters grew like evening light—
Subtle, tender, never trite;
He shaped the ordinary day
Into art that would never fade away.

His lens became a timeless door
To hopes and griefs we all explore;
And through each film, we learned to see
The poetry in simplicity.

Decades drift, yet on the screen
His visions stay, serene, unseen—
Until we watch, and once again
Ray teaches us what it means to be human.
