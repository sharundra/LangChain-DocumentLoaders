1. "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. Create scrpits demonstrating usage of TextLoader, PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader.
    # Because of loading a lot of PDFs, DirectoryLoader takes a lot of time to load. Also, we can't load a lot of PDFs in memory too. Hence concept of "lazy load'.
3. Create script for WebBaseLoader and CSVLoader too.
    # WebBaseLoader uses two libraries, "requests" and "BeautifulSoap4" to accomplish the task.
	#	requests -- sends the message to the server hosting the URL and receives the raw HTML.
	#	beautifulSoap4 -- It takes the raw html string and returns the clean, plain text that can be fed into LLM.
# While for TextLoader and WebBaseLoader, Entire given input content is just one document but for PyPDFLoader every page is a document and for CSVLoader, every row is a document.
# We can apply lazy_load for DirectoryLoader, PyPDFLoader and CSVLoader.
